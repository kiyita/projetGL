# Vainquished Realm

Vainquished Realm is a virtual reality video game developed for a software engineering project at [ENSSAT](https://enssat.fr) by the Team Kiwi. This game is made with the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org) ``v4.3`` and is configured to run on the Meta Quest VR headsets (tested with the Meta Quest 2 and 3). The game uses [Bastiaan Olij](https://github.com/BastiaanOlij)'s [OpenXR Vendors plugin](https://github.com/GodotVR/godot_openxr_vendors/releases) where all basic VR features have been implemented in GDscript.  

**Bellow, you'll find an installation guide to try our game.**

# 📥 Installation Guide

To install the project and build the game on your VR headset, you need the game's `.apk` file. You can either:

1. 🛠 **Build your own `.apk`** from the project using Godot.
2. 📦 **Use an existing `.apk`** and deploy it directly on your headset with the [Meta Quest Developer Hub](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/ts-odh/).

### 🎛 Create the Export Preset
To build the project as an `.apk` file, create an **Android runnable export preset**:

![Export preset](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92f15a41-69d6-400f-8600-73f5c2050090)

Then, enable **Gradle build**:

![Gradle build](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b4e0e4b-0151-4488-817d-dcc0046b9685)

Select **OpenXR** as the XR Mode in the XR Features menu:

![XR Features](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/011b07ed-de38-482a-b0f3-b55595996e63)

Enable the **Meta Plugin**:

![Meta Plugin](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cc974e6-05ce-4db7-b3fe-b879f29c578a)

---

### 🎮 Build on Your Headset
Once everything is set up, build the `.apk` and deploy it to your Meta Quest with remote debugging enabled:

![Build APK](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12b467f3-a9d7-434c-892f-30b1e9e8c54d)

#### 🛠 Troubleshooting
If you are on **Linux** and encounter an error with `adb`, remove the previous version with:

```bash
adb uninstall {your_project}
# Example: adb uninstall com.example.metrovr
```

---

## 📦 Use an Already Existing `.apk`

If you already have an `.apk` file, use the **Meta Quest Developer Hub** app to deploy it to your headset:

![Meta Quest Developer Hub](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a195d304-410e-4b30-b546-218da67ff1cf)

That’s it! 🚀 Enjoy your game on VR! 🎮
